​Multi-modal AI assistant: Generate Text, Code, Images, and Research directly in Gutenberg. Now supports Image Analysis (Vision).
​== Description ==
​Turn your WordPress editor into a powerful AI Content Studio. The "MP AI Content Generator" has evolved. It now seamlessly integrates multi-modal capabilities from Google Gemini and OpenAI (ChatGPT/DALL-E) directly into your WordPress post and page editor.
​Version 1.0.1.1 - "The Neural Studio Update"
This massive update transforms the plugin from a simple text writer into a comprehensive research and creation tool.
​👁️ Vision (Image Analysis): Select an image from your Media Library and ask the AI to describe it, write a caption, or use it as context for a blog post.
​🎨 Image Generation: Create stunning visuals using DALL-E 3 or Imagen 3 and automatically save them to your Media Library.
​🌍 Web Research: Perform live Google Searches to fetch up-to-date facts and cite sources.
​🕸️ Web Scraping: Paste a URL, and the AI will read the content to use as reference material.
​🔄 Model Sync: One-click sync button to fetch the latest models available to your API key (fixes "Model Not Found" errors).
​Features:
​Text & Code Generation: Dedicated modes for writing articles or generating clean, formatted code snippets.
​Native Blocks: Automatically converts AI output into core/heading, core/image, core/code, and core/list blocks.
​Secure: API Keys are now managed individually by each user in their Profile, ensuring privacy and separate quotas.
​Site Awareness: The AI detects your site's categories to provide better context and suggestions.
